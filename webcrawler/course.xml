However, the statements are based on management's financial reporting objectives (e.g. profit maximization; income smoothing; tax minimization), as well as on many management estimates and disclosure decisions. Statements based on GAAP do not usually reflect the needs of the individual user. In this course, students will learn to apply diagnostic, analytical and judgmental skills to understanding financial statements from the point of view of external users who need to make various types of decisions such as performance evaluation, loan decisions, and stock valuation.

Applying a pluralized concept of psychiatry, the course will investigate prevalent practices in clinical psychiatry alongside other culturally and historically formulated strategies of coming to terms with locally defined states of mental disorder. It will explore a diversity of modes of experiencing, expressing, recognizing, interpreting, and addressing mental distress, providing participants with a solid theoretical and conceptual basis while, at the same time, exploring a large body of specific empirical case studies. In so doing, the course offers well-contextualized insights into a number of current issues including the pharmaceutical commodification of mental health, the medicalization of difference, personhood and notions of a 'normal' human condition, stigma and idioms of distress, migration and trauma, psychiatric epidemiology and global mental health policy, and symbolic forms of healing. Engaging with ongoing controversies and debates, it encourages new and critical views onto the practical realities and structural challenges of mental disorder and suffering in Canada and beyond.</description><professor>Arne Steinforth</professor></course><course><courseCode>AP/ANTH 3320</courseCode><credit>6.00</credit><courseTitle>The Anthropology of Ritual & Religion</courseTitle><description>This course explores anthropological approaches to the study of religion & ritual in social, cultural and political context, through a variety of ethnographic examples.

The focus on discourse in this course explores this paradox. We examine connections between language and different form of knowledge - of culture, History, Anthropology - in making and sustaining race. We consider how discourses of identity and difference, culture and nature, converge with discourses of the body in multiple representations to make race, like gender, one of the most naturalized discourses of our time.</description><professor>Daniel Arthur Yon</professor></course><course><courseCode>GS/ANTH 5210</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Independent Directed Reading</courseTitle><description>: Independent Directed Reading Courses in Social Anthropology (Theoretical or Area Focus).(Staff) Note: In order to fulfill degree course requirements students may register for ONE Independent Directed Reading half-course.

In addition, corporate America saw the film industry as a means to encourage a consumerist lifestyle. Course credit exclusions: None.

Youth are understood in terms of their media uses and productions as learners, consumers, producers and artists across complex relations of power, discursive frameworks and dynamic experiences. Oriented toward conceptualizing "youth," "culture" and "media practices" in relational, historically nuanced and culturally situated ways, we will examine and undertake qualitative youth media research with critical and reflexive theoretical and methodological tools. Our goal is to balance an understanding of hegemonic forces of commodification controlled by corporate media with emerging and changing relations in which youth collectively transform the conditions, forms and directions of their media participation.

For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined. Prerequisite: Grade 12U Advanced Functions or equivalent. Prerequisites/Co-requisites: AP/ECON 1000 3.00 or AP/ECON 1010 3.00, or equivalent.

Again, relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming. As in AP/ECON 1530 3.0, many topics and issues are addressed and problem framing and problem solving abilities are enhanced. Prerequisite: AP/ECON 1530 3.00 or equivalent.

Drawing on classical and contemporary philosophy and theory we will explore how education is concerned with cultivating the human and the possibility of a common world. To wonder again about what education is for  in an existential, political and ethical sense  we will ask about the nature of authority, power and freedom, about what justifies and bounds our interactions in education, and about the possibility of fostering the philosophical soul.</description><professor>Mario G. DiPaolantonio</professor></course><course><courseCode>ED/EDST 1100</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Situated Learning and Education</courseTitle><description>Situated theories of learning are introduced in this course and contrasted with other theories of learning. Situated learning theories also are critically examined in relation to the kinds of educational experiences that flow from the manner in which learning is framed, who or what the teacher is in any one instance of learning, how the learner is positioned, and the role of the interpersonal dynamics such as affect and power. The implications of situated theories of learning are considered in relation to the provisioning of educational experiences in a variety of contexts, with particular reference to a life-long learning perspective.</description><professor>Angela Robinson</professor></course><course><courseCode>ED/EDST 1200</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Place and Learning</courseTitle><description>Physical spaces invite certain types of engagements with the world while precluding others. This course explores the role of physical spaces in learning with specific reference to emotion, curiosity and relationality. Drawing on scholarship from a range of disciplines including geography, architecture, design, environmental studies and education, the course: a) reviews the history of thinking about the design of "instructional space" in schools, museums, galleries and other spaces intended to support learning; investigate the learning potential of other spaces, natural (wilderness, desert, etc.) and human-made (malls, streetcorners, etc.); b) considers the conditions that inhibit and inspire learning; and c) explores the implications for individual learning, public education, and civic engagement.</description><professor>Steven John Alsop</professor></course><course><courseCode>ED/EDST 2200</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Issues in Indigenous Education</courseTitle><description>This course explores wide-ranging issues in Indigenous education.

Novels, films, exhibitions, photography, and memorials are among the types of representations that may be examined in the course. The course considers how cultural representations of pedagogy affect contemporary ideas about teaching and learning. Social institutions and popular culture have the capacity to create, not just reflect, knowledge. A central assumption of the course is that cultural representations impact the ways that educators understand themselves and their work. The course raises questions about the significance of cultural depictions, their historical and social formation, and their value for theorizing multiple learning environments.</description><professor>Warren Earl Crichlow</professor></course><course><courseCode>ED/EDST 3730</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Education and Human Rights</courseTitle><description>This course provides an analysis of human rights law as it intersects with education and schooling in Ontario.

This course will offer opportunities for future PJ and JI teachers to explore these key mathematical processes, identified in the Ontario curriculum, through investigations, reflections, and selective readings from the literature. Many pre-service teachers have not themselves experienced learning and doing mathematics with these broader, more connected and inclusive approaches. They lack the confidence and the background resources to support these mathematical processes and approaches with their students. Reworking sample mathematics with these supports, including manipulatives (as described in the Ontario Curriculum) and appropriate technology (dynamic geometry, as identified in the Ontario Curriculum) provides opportunities for future teachers to develop their mathematical repertoire and confidence, as well as their capacity to offer active engagement with multiple approaches that can support the diversity of student thinking found in problem solving situations. The activities selected, and the associated group projects, will also cross-curricular boundaries and cultural boundaries to connect mathematics and spatial reasoning to real world experiences. These activities and reflections will also connect to learning objectives and concepts from science, social sciences such as geography, and visual arts, supporting a broad range of connected student learning in the STEM and STEAM disciplines, and beyond. A key component will be building and exploring embodied approaches, including spatial reasoning, kinesthetic and spatial-visual representations to support learning and thinking for children and in the elementary classrooms. These approaches are also central in the practices of mathematics, the sciences and many of the arts, at all levels and across most cultures. They will support a lifetime of student and teacher learning.</description><professor>Heather Bourrie</professor></course><course><courseCode>ED/EDUC 2700</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Teaching Internationally and Interculturally</courseTitle><description>This course engages students in a comparative and international exploration of cultural traditions and beliefs, as well as their reflection on schooling and teaching practices.

Examples include technological networks (e.g., World Wide Web), online social networks (e.g., Facebook), biological networks (e.g., Protein-to-Protein interactions), and more. The study of information networks is an emerging discipline of immense importance that combines graph theory, probability and statistics, data mining and analysis, and computational social science. This course provides students with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience of the field by covering models and algorithms of information networks and their basic properties. In addition, analysis of information networks provides the means to explore large, complex data coming from vastly diverse sources and to inform computational problems and better decisions. Topics include: basic graph theory, network measurements, network models, community detection, graph partitioning, link analysis, link prediction, information cascades & epidemics, influence maximization, network ties, recommendation systems, mining graphs, and connections to problems in the social sciences and economics.

The enormous size of today's data sets and the specific requirements of modern applications, necessitated the growth of a new generation of data management systems, where the emphasis is put on distributed and fault-tolerant processing. New programming paradigms have evolved, an abundance of information latforms offering data management and analysis solutions appeared and a number of novel methods and tools have been developed. This course introduces the fundamentals of big data storage, retrieval, and processing systems. As these fundamentals are introduced, exemplary technologies are used to illustrate how big data systems can leverage very large data sets that become available through multiple sources and are characterized by diverse levels of volume (terabytes; billion records), velocity (batch; real-time; streaming) and variety (structured; semi-structured; unstructured). The course aims to provide students with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience of the field by covering recent research on big data systems and their basic properties. Students consider both small and large datasets because both are equally important and justify different trade-offs. Topics include: software frameworks for distributed storage and processing of very large data sets, MapReduce programming model, querying of structured data sets, column stores, key-value stores, document stores, graph databases, distributed stream processing frameworks.

In the knowledge-intensive economy, intellectual assets like human capital, intellectual property, brands, and trademarks are becoming an increasingly important proportion of a firm's total wealth. And yet, most firms do a poor job of managing intellectual capital strategically. In this course, we adopt a "lifecycle" approach to the management of an intellectual asset. This lifecycle covers the creation of the intellectual asset, the codification of the asset in the form of intellectual property (IP), the valuation of intellectual assets, the protection of intellectual assets, and leveraging of intellectual assets.</description></course><course><courseCode>SB/EMBA 6700</courseCode><credit>2.00</credit><courseTitle>Deal-Making in China and Asia</courseTitle><description>This course focuses on formulating and applying strategies in a real world, transaction by transaction context, in the Asia Pacific region. Among the principal strategies examined are: 1) negotiating strategies; 2) entry strategies; 3) pricing strategies; and 4) strategies for dealing with governments and state-owned enterprises. The course is taught from the perspective of management decision-making. In many cases, the participant is placed at the negotiating table and has the opportunity to create appropriate deal strategies. Principal objective include: 1) offering the participant through the reading materials and handouts a comprehensive overview of doing business in the Asia Pacific region; and 2) offering the participant, through a series of short-form cases ("caselets"), the opportunity to strategize and be the decision maker in practical, "real world" business situations throughout the Asia Pacific region, which illustrate successful and unsuccessful management strategies in Asia.</description></course><course><courseCode>SB/EMBA 6720</courseCode><credit>2.00</credit><courseTitle>Understanding Consumers</courseTitle><description>This course focuses on the customer as an individual, with an emphasis on how consumers react to marketing information provided about a product. The topics discussed comprise an examination of basic psychological processes in a logical sequence: i.e., exposure, attention, perception, memory, persuasion, and decision-making. Advertising - and how consumers process ads - is the major vehicle used to clarify these concepts. In addition, the nature and importance of cultural differences in consumer behaviour around the world is a pervasive theme throughout. Thus, this course provides both a micro and macro perspective on the factors influencing a customer.</description></course><course><courseCode>SB/EMBA 6770</courseCode><credit>2.00</credit><courseTitle>Strategic Challenges in Emerging Markets</courseTitle><description>This course provides toolkits and frameworks to successfully confront the challenges of achieving competitive advantage in emerging markets.

The first is to help students take a more structured and scientific approach to the evaluation of data. Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research.</description><professor>Henry Bartel</professor><professor>Rodolfo Rivas Molina</professor></course><course><courseCode>GS/FACC 6500</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Corporate Governance</courseTitle><description>Effective corporate governance is crucial to a successful and sustainable corporate enterprise.

Maple is used as a computer algebra system and then as a generator of codes in C++ and/or FORTRAN. This course provides an overview of the major components of fixed income markets, including a review of the major instruments, the issuers and the investors. The valuation of interest-rate sensitive cash flows is the underlying theme. Major topics covered include: theories of the term structure, institutional aspects of the fixed income markets, and analytical techniques for managing interest rate risk. The course will concentrate on modern valuation methods as well as traditional techniques for risk management in the fixed income market. The effect of the assumed interest rate dynamics and the prevailing interest rate condition for the riskiness and value of various features of these contracts will also be analyzed. The power of convexity and duration upon risk management and valuation will be developed. Students will use the substantive approaches developed in the course to address concrete problems. The coursework will include a project dealing with Canadian data.

It examines the physical, chemical and biological processes by which landscapes affect and are affected by climate. The central focus is that ecosystems, through their cycling of energy, water, chemical elements and trace gases are important determinants of climate.The coupling between climate and vegetation is seen at spatial scales from the leaf to biomes and at timescales from seconds to millennia. Both natural vegetation dynamics and human induced land-use changes are mechanisms of climate change. The course combines a theoretical understanding of ecological climatology with applied experimentation to reinforce the principals involved.</description><professor>Richard Bello</professor></course><course><courseCode>GS/GEOG 5608</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Hydrometeorology: Evapotranspiration</courseTitle><description>Evaporation consumes the largest proportion of precipitation falling to the Earths surface and the latent energy generated by evaporation drives the atmospheric hydrological cycle.

It has careened from an open democracy to brutal dictatorship, been united, divided, and united again in a little over 100 years, embraced the rational optimism of the Enlightenment and the racism of Nazi Germany culminating in the Holocaust. This course examines cultural representations of contemporary and historical Germany from an interdisciplinary perspective. Examining cultural, political and social discourses, we will consider the tensions that have characterized "Germany" historically and in the present day through the lens of texts that include e.g. literature, film, art, journalistic and political writing. Particular attention will be paid to: Nationalism and multiculturalism, authority and resistance, competing visions of democracy or freedom, religion and rationalism, the role of Germany in Europe and the world, and the effect of the past on contemporary German society.

It reviews historical and contemporary feminist perspectives of women's professional work that explain the feminization and gendered organization of professions. Specific attention is paid to the pursuit of 'professional projects' that attempt to establish women's credibility and/or challenge the masculine culture of professional occupations. Women's participation in both female-predominant (e.g. nursing and social work) and traditional male pre-dominant professions (e.g. law and engineering) is explored. Topics include analysis of recent developments such as the effects of austerity policies on professional groups in the public sector (health care, education, social services); work/life balance; patterns of racialized exclusion in traditionally white feminized occupations; and professional groups' policy approaches to challenging sex, race and other forms of discrimination within their profession.

The course examines money from a range of disciplinary perspectives, including anthropology, archaeology, economics, history, literature, political science, psychology, religious studies, and sociology, devoting two weeks to each enduring and apparently simple question. As an introduction to one of the fundamental ideas/substances of human life, the course brings interdisciplinary knowledge, breadth, and a range of scholarly approaches to a particular subject.

So too do financial crises, engineering failures, and disease outbreaks. Disasters are as much a product of culture as they are of nature. They are shaped by political, social, economic, and environmental context.

The course also covers a wide geographical range including the pirates of the Adriatic and Mediterranean Sea, pirates of China and India, piracy in the Atlantic and Caribbean world, and the current issues associated with pirates in Somalia.

Each student is required to write a major research paper on a homicide occurring within the Province of Ontario. This paper is based principally on printed and archival sources. In order to assist this research, students are instructed on using online sources as well as archival repositories in the GTA and surrounding area. In the first term, students meet with the instructor and are given weekly assignments, which will form the basis for in class discussions. These assignments provide students guidance on using various types of quantitative and qualitative sources. Quantitative sources, such as the federal census of 1871, provincial vital statistics, and parish registers are used. Qualitative sources, such as newspapers, benchbooks, and coroner's inquests are also used. In the second term, the class moves to the Archives of Ontario where students research their essay and where the instructor assists in deciphering and interpreting documents. Though students are not required to use other repositories in the GTA, such as the United Church Archives and the City of Toronto Archives, they are encouraged to do so.

This course focuses on nineteenth century British and European science and its social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts. Adopting the contextualist approach to the history of science allows us to raise a series of provocative questions: in what way did all of these different contexts shape the nature of nineteenth century scientific thought? How were scientific facts socially constructed? What was it about the nineteenth century context that led many intellectuals to reject Christianity and embrace science as providing a new, privileged form of knowledge? Included among the topics to be covered are the discourse of natural theology, the politics of geological controversy, Scottish philosophy and phrenology, radical working class Lamarckianism in England during the 1830s, the plurality of worlds debate, science and gender, the professionalization of science, English scientific naturalism and German scientific materialism, the literary structure of Darwin's Origin of Species, Darwinian theory and its ideological uses, and late nineteenth century physics and psychics. This course will be of interest to students of British, European, social, and intellectual history.</description><professor>Bernard V Lightman</professor></course><course><courseCode>GS/HIST 5870</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Earth, Time and History</courseTitle><description>This course examines the development of an historical understanding of the Earth, and the related notion of the Earth and the environment as a dynamic system, starting in the late eighteenth century.</description><professor>Ernst Hamm</professor></course><course><courseCode>GS/HIST 5901</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>The African Diaspora</courseTitle><description>This seminar examines the slave trade and the African diaspora, including the regional and ethnic origins of the enslaved population, the demographic structure of the slave trade, and the cultural and social adjustments of people under slavery.

It has careened from an open democracy to brutal dictatorship, been united, divided, and united again in a little over 100 years, embraced the rational optimism of the Enlightenment and the racism of Nazi Germany culminating in the Holocaust. This course examines cultural representations of contemporary and historical Germany from an interdisciplinary perspective. Examining cultural, political and social discourses, we will consider the tensions that have characterized "Germany" historically and in the present day through the lens of texts that include e.g. literature, film, art, journalistic and political writing. Particular attention will be paid to: Nationalism and multiculturalism, authority and resistance, competing visions of democracy or freedom, religion and rationalism, the role of Germany in Europe and the world, and the effect of the past on contemporary German society.

Diaspora is a term that describes a group of people who identify with a particular nationality, region, religion, ethnicity, culture, or language, but have, for various reasons, migrated to different parts of the world. People in diasporas may live distantly from each other or from a place they consider to be 'home', but may still consider themselves to be part of a collective, community, or culture. The course asks how diasporic writers and artists confront and critique ideas of culture. What new cultural formations emerge in diasporic artistic expressions in literature, music, and film? Students engage with a number of theoretical texts and thinkers on the concept of diaspora, as well as literary works, films, and music produced by and about diasporic people.

This course focuses on nineteenth century British and European science and its social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts. Adopting the contextualist approach to the history of science allows us to raise a series of provocative questions: in what way did all of these different contexts shape the nature of nineteenth century scientific thought? How were scientific facts socially constructed? What was it about the nineteenth century context that led many intellectuals to reject Christianity and embrace science as providing a new, privileged form of knowledge? Included among the topics to be covered are the discourse of natural theology, the politics of geological controversy, Scottish philosophy and phrenology, radical working class Lamarckianism in England during the 1830s, the plurality of worlds debate, science and gender, the professionalization of science, English scientific naturalism and German scientific materialism, the literary structure of Darwin's Origin of Species, Darwinian theory and its ideological uses, and late nineteenth century physics and psychics. This course will be of interest to students of British, European, social, and intellectual history.</description><professor>Bernard V Lightman</professor></course><course><courseCode>GS/HUMA 6327</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>lntermedial Bloomsbury: Literature, Visual Art, and the Omega Workshop</courseTitle><description>This course examines the various forms of art and their intersections in the work of the Bloomsbury Group.</description><professor>Elicia A. Clements</professor></course><course><courseCode>GS/HUMA 6334</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>A History of Reading: Texts and Artifacts from Antiquity to the Digital Age</courseTitle><description>This course examines the nature and history of reading from an interdisciplinary perspective.

The course starts by discussing how media discourse is different from everyday interaction, and how differently language is used in different types of media. It then focuses on the characteristics of Japanese found in the media. Specific words, sentence structures, and styles of language use both in written and spoken data are analyzed. Such data include Japanese used in news, advertisements, public signs, music lyrics, and blogs. Students also compare the language with examples of similar contexts in English. Through these analyses, the course fosters 1) ability to explore and express ideas about the Japanese language and media discourse, 2) comprehension of the ways interlocutors interact with their audiences through various Japanese media, and 3) cultural insights that manifest in media discourse in Japanese. During the course, students are expected to survey research on each topic and later conduct original research by gathering and analyzing discourse in specific media.

There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings must underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. The general approach of the course will be exploratory rather than didactic. At all levels, learning can be thought of as research: an active construction of personal knowledge, based on formulating and testing hypotheses and, in light of an evaluation of the results, modifying one's beliefs and practices. In this spirit, we shall attempt to make connections between the reading, writing and discussion that take place in the course, and the reading, writing and discussion of the classroom setting. Class sessions will vary in format and will include discussions of the readings which are set for each week, lectures, guest presentations and work on individual and group projects.

Courses are not open for auditing.</description></course><course><courseCode>ED/LLDV 3736</courseCode><credit>6.00</credit><courseTitle>Language and Literacy Development in Deaf and Hard of Hearing Learners II</courseTitle><description>The central purposes of this course are to develop an understanding of reading and writing processes in learners with hearing loss, and to develop knowledge about the pedagogical practices and assessment/evaluation strategies that support text-based literacy development in this population. There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. This course will provide teacher candidates with the skills and knowledge needed to provide assessment and instruction in the development of spoken language through listening, to learners who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing from preschool to school age. Information about typical child development and the impact of hearing loss on child development and school achievement will be presented. Assessment and instruction techniques will be presented and then applied during the practicum and case studies.

Proceeding from the practical insights of those who tell stories in many forms, the course will also explore the growing use of narrative in a wide range of fields towards rethinking social and institutional assumptions and releasing human potential. Open to non-majors. Ranging across multiple Creative Arts (Film & Television, Interactive & Transmedia, Oral Literature & Folklore, Literature & Creative Writing), Humanities (Native Studies, Education, Religious Studies, Psychology, Journalism, Peace & Conflict Studies) and Sciences (Life Sciences, Cosmology, Health & Medicine), the course will follow the thread of story as it informs, and is informed by, each discipline. A range of learning activities will involve students in individual and group work equally demanding of analytical rigour, creative imagination, and personal reflection; while building first-year University skills at research, writing, and informed discussion. Key insights from the cultural knowledge of First Nations and other indigenous peoples, traditionally rooted in story, will frame the course's epistemological approach.</description><professor>Morgan Fics</professor></course><course><courseCode>FA/PANF 3140</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Production Design for Film 1</courseTitle><description>Introduces the fundamentals of film production design, from conceptualization to set building to set decoration and props, make-up and costume.

Students must present sufficient written work to form a basis for discussions and for assessment of progress. Directed reading courses are intended to enable students to pursue a research interest not covered by any of the seminar courses offered in that year; to enable them to explore an unfamiliar topic with a view to making it the topic of the thesis or dissertation; or to fill a gap in their knowledge which might impede their speical research. M.A. students may not substitute more than one, or Ph.D. students more than two directed readings for regular seminar courses. Directed reading courses are given ex gratia by members of the faculty and the approval of the Programme Director must be obtained in advance.

This course asks: What can we learn about international politics from popular culture? The common notions of international politics are certainly found in many of the expressions or contemporary popular culture: novels, television, and, particularly, film have made the world of international espionage one of its staples. With the declaration of a 'war on terror' in 2001, terrorists and the provision of security against them have also provided important themes for popular entertainments. However, by virtue of being 'popular', popular culture also presents the possibilities of politics that are not abstracted and insulated from the concerns and experiences of everyday life and experience. Thus, while international politics in popular culture can reproduce alienated or elite versions of our world's politics it can also be a site of resistance, and even more importantly a place to imagine international politics differently. This course draws the popular culture in which we all live in our 'daily' lives into the classroom, beginning from popular culture expressions to explore the nature, limits, and possibilities of contemporary international politics.

This course focuses on nineteenth century British and European science and its social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts. Adopting the contextualist approach to the history of science allows us to raise a series of provocative questions: in what way did all of these different contexts shape the nature of nineteenth century scientific thought? How were scientific facts socially constructed? What was it about the nineteenth century context that led many intellectuals to reject Christianity and embrace science as providing a new, privileged form of knowledge? Included among the topics to be covered are the discourse of natural theology, the politics of geological controversy, Scottish philosophy and phrenology, radical working class Lamarckianism in England during the 1830s, the plurality of worlds debate, science and gender, the professionalization of science, English scientific naturalism and German scientific materialism, the literary structure of Darwin's Origin of Species, Darwinian theory and its ideological uses, and late nineteenth century physics and psychics.

This course focuses on nineteenth century British and European science and its social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts. Adopting the contextualist approach to the history of science allows us to raise a series of provocative questions: in what way did all of these different contexts shape the nature of nineteenth century scientific thought? How were scientific facts socially constructed? What was it about the nineteenth century context that led many intellectuals to reject Christianity and embrace science as providing a new, privileged form of knowledge? Included among the topics to be covered are the discourse of natural theology, the politics of geological controversy, Scottish philosophy and phrenology, radical working class Lamarckianism in England during the 1830s, the plurality of worlds debate, science and gender, the professionalization of science, English scientific naturalism and German scientific materialism, the literary structure of Darwin's Origin of Species, Darwinian theory and its ideological uses, and late nineteenth century physics and psychics. This course will be of interest to students of British, European, social, and intellectual history.</description><professor>Bernard V Lightman</professor></course><course><courseCode>GS/STS 6308</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Collecting Science: Lives of Objects</courseTitle><description>This course addresses the collection, classification, display, and reception of objects representing aspects of scientific knowledge within the Western tradition through a variety of themes and case studies.</description><professor>Leslie Korrick</professor></course><course><courseCode>GS/STS 6309</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Objectivity</courseTitle><description>This course explores the various ways that Science and Technology Studies scholars have dissected, debunked, reconstructed, and championed the concept of objectivity.

The course assignments stress individual approaches to creative problem solving. Fundamental concepts relevant to traditional and emerging sculptural production such as weight, mass, volume, context and space will be discussed in class and experienced through the execution of individual projects. The sculptural processes of basic wood fabrication will introduce students to a range of sculptural methodologies and skills employing milling, shaping, carving, joinery and finishing. Through in-class demonstrations students will be introduced to a range of skills and tools to be utilized in the production of their studio projects. Assignments will consist of series projects exploring different working processes and sculptural methodologies. In addition to these projects there will be in-class discussions, technical assignments and readings that will engage students in the dialogue surrounding contemporary concerns associated with abstraction and spatial awareness. Craftsmanship and a demonstrated knowledge of material are a major factor in this course. In order for students to be able to fully articulate their idea in a given material, they must understand the limits and possibilities inherent in the construction process. It is expected that each student will develop a degree of sophistication and competence when working with wood as a material. Lectures, demonstrations, group critiques and most importantly, hands on instruction are the essential means by which we will investigate sculptural problem solving. The class will participate in material specific demonstrations and/or class critiques of finished work. Periodically there will be in-class work periods, but it is expected that the majority of the assignments will be completed outside of class time.</description><professor>Kevin M Yates</professor></course><course><courseCode>FA/VISA 2039</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Introduction to Metal Sculpture</courseTitle><description>designed to engage students in creating three-dimensional, non-representational sculpture in steel.

The sculptural processes of basic metal fabrication will introduce students to a range of sculptural methodologies and skills employing forming, cutting, welding, chasing and finishing. Through in-class demonstrations students will be introduced to a range of skills and tools to be utilized in the production of their studio projects. Assignments will consist of series projects exploring different working processes and sculptural methodologies. In addition to these projects there will be in-class discussions, technical assignments and readings that will engage students in the dialogue surrounding contemporary concerns associated with abstraction and spatial awareness. Craftsmanship and a demonstrated knowledge of material are a major factor in this course. In order for students to be able to fully articulate their idea in a given material, they must understand the limits and possibilities inherent in the construction process. It is expected that each student will develop a degree of sophistication and competence when working with this material. Lectures, demonstrations, group critiques and most importantly, hands on instruction are the essential means by which we will investigate sculptural problem solving. The class will participate in material specific demonstrations and/or class critiques of finished work. Periodically there will be in-class work periods, but it is expected that the majority of the assignments will be completed outside of class time.</description></course><course><courseCode>FA/VISA 2060</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Introductory Photography: Black and White</courseTitle><description>Focuses on the creation and production of black and white photographs in this hands-on studio course.
