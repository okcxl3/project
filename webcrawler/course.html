However, the statements are based on management's financial reporting objectives (e.g. profit maximization; income smoothing; tax minimization), as well as on many management estimates and disclosure decisions. Statements based on GAAP do not usually reflect the needs of the individual user. In this course, students will learn to apply diagnostic, analytical and judgmental skills to understanding financial statements from the point of view of external users who need to make various types of decisions such as performance evaluation, loan decisions, and stock valuation.

For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined.

Again, relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming.

To wonder again about what education is for  in an existential, political and ethical sense  we will ask about the nature of authority, power and freedom, about what justifies and bounds our interactions in education, and about the possibility of fostering the philosophical soul.</td><td>Mario G. DiPaolantonio</td></tr><tr><td>ED/EDST 1100</td><td>3.00</td><td>Situated Learning and Education</td><td>Situated theories of learning are introduced in this course and contrasted with other theories of learning.

A central assumption of the course is that cultural representations impact the ways that educators understand themselves and their work.

This course will offer opportunities for future PJ and JI teachers to explore these key mathematical processes, identified in the Ontario curriculum, through investigations, reflections, and selective readings from the literature. Many pre-service teachers have not themselves experienced learning and doing mathematics with these broader, more connected and inclusive approaches. They lack the confidence and the background resources to support these mathematical processes and approaches with their students. Reworking sample mathematics with these supports, including manipulatives (as described in the Ontario Curriculum) and appropriate technology (dynamic geometry, as identified in the Ontario Curriculum) provides opportunities for future teachers to develop their mathematical repertoire and confidence, as well as their capacity to offer active engagement with multiple approaches that can support the diversity of student thinking found in problem solving situations. The activities selected, and the associated group projects, will also cross-curricular boundaries and cultural boundaries to connect mathematics and spatial reasoning to real world experiences. These activities and reflections will also connect to learning objectives and concepts from science, social sciences such as geography, and visual arts, supporting a broad range of connected student learning in the STEM and STEAM disciplines, and beyond. A key component will be building and exploring embodied approaches, including spatial reasoning, kinesthetic and spatial-visual representations to support learning and thinking for children and in the elementary classrooms. These approaches are also central in the practices of mathematics, the sciences and many of the arts, at all levels and across most cultures.

It uses a problem-based pedagogy to expose the underlying concepts and an experiential laboratory to implement them. The programming language is chosen so that it is widely used in a variety of applications, is object-oriented, and is of industrial strength (Java is an example of such a language). The problems are chosen in order to expose abstract programming concepts by immersing them in relevant and engaging applications. The experiential laboratory is based on sensors and actuators that connect to a computer. The problems are chosen with consultation with the various engineering disciplines in the Faculty with a view of exposing how computing is used in these disciplines. Two hours per week lectures and three hours per week for lab work and tutorials. Prerequisites: LE/EECS1011 3.00.

The first is to help students take a more structured and scientific approach to the evaluation of data. Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research.</td><td>Henry Bartel</td><td>Rodolfo Rivas Molina</td></tr><tr><td>GS/FACC 6500</td><td>3.00</td><td>Corporate Governance</td><td>Effective corporate governance is crucial to a successful and sustainable corporate enterprise.

Issues such as governance, transparency, and performance measurement are tailored to the unique challenges faced by these entities.</td></tr><tr><td>GS/FACC 6700</td><td>3.00</td><td>Executive Compensation</td><td>Most modern management theories posit that principal drivers of managerial behavior are executive compensation schemes. It is also a common belief that compensation schemes tied to the bottom line and stock price lead to actions more in the manager's interest than the firm's interest. This course looks at these issues and identifies best practices to strengthen corporate governance and accountability in the organization through appropriate design of executive compensation schemes. The revised course description reflects the reality that executive compensation dominates all benefits in terms of impact on accountability and governance.</td><td>Steve Chan</td></tr><tr><td>GS/FACC 6800</td><td>3.00</td><td>Synthesis of theory and practice, governance and accountability</td><td>Capstone course In the Graduate Program in Financial Accountability which integrates theories and practices from the previous courses and applies them in an experiential learning format.</td><td>Mark Smith</td></tr><tr><td>GS/FACC 6870</td><td>3.00</td><td>Advanced Techniques of Financial Analysis</td><td>In addition to exploring advanced techniques of financial statement analysis, including how to understand and use the information that appears in annual reports inside and outside audited financial statements, students explore two topics not commonly found in courses dealing with financial statements: 1) advanced techniques of cash flow analysis; and 2) distribution sustainability and governance of income trusts.

How were scientific facts socially constructed? What was it about the nineteenth century context that led many intellectuals to reject Christianity and embrace science as providing a new, privileged form of knowledge? Included among the topics to be covered are the discourse of natural theology, the politics of geological controversy, Scottish philosophy and phrenology, radical working class Lamarckianism in England during the 1830s, the plurality of worlds debate, science and gender, the professionalization of science, English scientific naturalism and German scientific materialism, the literary structure of Darwin's Origin of Species, Darwinian theory and its ideological uses, and late nineteenth century physics and psychics.

How were scientific facts socially constructed? What was it about the nineteenth century context that led many intellectuals to reject Christianity and embrace science as providing a new, privileged form of knowledge? Included among the topics to be covered are the discourse of natural theology, the politics of geological controversy, Scottish philosophy and phrenology, radical working class Lamarckianism in England during the 1830s, the plurality of worlds debate, science and gender, the professionalization of science, English scientific naturalism and German scientific materialism, the literary structure of Darwin's Origin of Species, Darwinian theory and its ideological uses, and late nineteenth century physics and psychics.

The seminar will focus initially on reading about theories and policies in family law, using one or more examples to explore the impact of the processes for family lawyers and their clients. Students will be expected to participate actively in these discussions, and to make brief presentation on assigned materials. In addition, students will choose a topic for a research essay that examiners the policy process in relation to a specific issue of family law reform, linking the course materials and discussions to their essay topics.

The emphasis is upon exploring the fundamental theoretical premises, principles and policies that underpin IP systems. Over the last two decades, the power of IP rights-holders has expanded dramatically. It is important, therefore, to analyze the justifications for IP rights and their limits. The various theoretical foundation, and critiques of IP include theories based in: Lockean labour -desert, German idealist personality rights, economic utilitarianism, democratic governance, cultural studies, feminism, human rights and post-structuralism. The objectives of the seminar are: to develop students understanding of the theoretical framework for IP protection; to further students awareness of the practical and political significance of IP la; and to encourage students to critically evaluate the normatic bases of IP rights.

There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings must underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. The general approach of the course will be exploratory rather than didactic. At all levels, learning can be thought of as research: an active construction of personal knowledge, based on formulating and testing hypotheses and, in light of an evaluation of the results, modifying one's beliefs and practices. In this spirit, we shall attempt to make connections between the reading, writing and discussion that take place in the course, and the reading, writing and discussion of the classroom setting. Class sessions will vary in format and will include discussions of the readings which are set for each week, lectures, guest presentations and work on individual and group projects.

There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. This course will provide teacher candidates with the skills and knowledge needed to provide assessment and instruction in the development of spoken language through listening, to learners who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing from preschool to school age. Information about typical child development and the impact of hearing loss on child development and school achievement will be presented. Assessment and instruction techniques will be presented and then applied during the practicum and case studies.

This course asks: What can we learn about international politics from popular culture? The common notions of international politics are certainly found in many of the expressions or contemporary popular culture: novels, television, and, particularly, film have made the world of international espionage one of its staples. With the declaration of a 'war on terror' in 2001, terrorists and the provision of security against them have also provided important themes for popular entertainments. However, by virtue of being 'popular', popular culture also presents the possibilities of politics that are not abstracted and insulated from the concerns and experiences of everyday life and experience. Thus, while international politics in popular culture can reproduce alienated or elite versions of our world's politics it can also be a site of resistance, and even more importantly a place to imagine international politics differently. This course draws the popular culture in which we all live in our 'daily' lives into the classroom, beginning from popular culture expressions to explore the nature, limits, and possibilities of contemporary international politics.

This course focuses on nineteenth century British and European science and its social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts. Adopting the contextualist approach to the history of science allows us to raise a series of provocative questions: in what way did all of these different contexts shape the nature of nineteenth century scientific thought? How were scientific facts socially constructed? What was it about the nineteenth century context that led many intellectuals to reject Christianity and embrace science as providing a new, privileged form of knowledge? Included among the topics to be covered are the discourse of natural theology, the politics of geological controversy, Scottish philosophy and phrenology, radical working class Lamarckianism in England during the 1830s, the plurality of worlds debate, science and gender, the professionalization of science, English scientific naturalism and German scientific materialism, the literary structure of Darwin's Origin of Species, Darwinian theory and its ideological uses, and late nineteenth century physics and psychics.
